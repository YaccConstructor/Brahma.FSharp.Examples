Brahma.FSharp.Examples
======================

Examples of Brahma.FSharp usage. 

Brahma.FSharp
-------------

Brahma.FSharp is a library for F# quotations to OpenCL translation.

<div class="row">
  <div class="span1"></div>
  <div class="span6">
    <div class="well well-small" id="nuget">
      The Brahma.FSharp library can be <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Brahma.FSharp">installed from NuGet</a>:
      <pre>PM> Install-Package Brahma.FSharp</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="span1"></div>
</div>

Features of Brahma.FSharp:

 * We are aimed to translate native F# code to OpenCL with minimization of different wrappers and custom types.
 * We use OpenCL for communication with GPU. So, you can work not only with NVIDIA hardware but with any device, 
which supports OpenCL (e.g. with AMD devices).
 * We support tuples and structures.
 * We can use strongly typed kernels from OpenCL code in F#.

Example
-------

This example demonstrates using a function defined in this library.
Following function computes the result of the addition of matrix 'mat2' to the matrix 'mat1'

*)
let Addition (mat1: array<float>) (mat2: array<float>) rows columns =

    let localWorkSize0 = 2
    let localWorkSize1 = 2
    let platformName = "NVIDIA*"
    let deviceType = DeviceType.Default        
    
    let provider =
        try  ComputeProvider.Create(platformName, deviceType)
        with 
        | ex -> failwith ex.Message
   
    let commandQueue = new CommandQueue(provider, provider.Devices |> Seq.head)    

    let command = 
        <@
            fun (rng:_2D) (a:array<_>) (b:array<_>) (c:array<_>) ->
                let x = rng.GlobalID1
                let y = rng.GlobalID0                
                c.[y * columns + x] <- a.[y * columns + x] + b.[y * columns + x] 
        @>

    let a = mat1
    let b = mat2
    let res = Array.zeroCreate(rows * columns)

    let kernel, kernelPrepare, kernelRun = provider.Compile command
    let d =(new _2D(rows, columns, localWorkSize0, localWorkSize1))
    kernelPrepare d a b res

    let _ = commandQueue.Add(kernelRun())
    let _ = commandQueue.Add(res.ToHost provider).Finish()
    commandQueue.Dispose()
    provider.Dispose()
    provider.CloseAllBuffers()

    res
